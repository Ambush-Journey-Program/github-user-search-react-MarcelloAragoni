**Author**: @Guilherme Kuniyoshi 

**Tags:** [React, JavaScript, Componentization]

**Name:** `github-user-search-app-react`

## Brief

Your challenge is to build the previously built Github user search app and get it looking as close to the design as possible, but this time using React.js.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- UI should match Figma file.
- User should be able to search for a github user.
- The app should be build using React.

## Tips

- Try to break the App into smaller components, abstracting not just the UI but also the logic for each component.
- Try to create smaller PRs, you can create 1 PR for each component that you are implementing.
- Use the JavaScript [Fetch method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) to implement the request.
- Fetch the [https://api.github.com/users/](https://api.github.com/users/guilhermekuni)<username> endpoint to retrieve the user information.
    - Since this is a public GET endpoint, you can copy and paste the URL in the browser to test and see the results.

## Achievements

- React.js
- Componentization
